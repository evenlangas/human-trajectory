# Human trajectory simulation and classification

This project presents the code related to the paper "Human Trajectory Simulation In Industrial Settings Using the Ornstein Uhlenbeck Process and Deep Learning Based Classification". It includes the code behind creating the LSTM model in lstm.ipynb and the BiLSTM model in bilstm.ipynb. Lastly results.ipynb is used for printing results. To reuse this file, it depends on .keras files and the dataset csv files to print the results. These files, as well as the Matlab code for simulating human motion will be uploaded at a later stage.
